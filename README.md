- Architecture
  - The architecture consists of a few different types of front end development. Express HTML was able to complete routes with controllers and display a number of pages. JavaScript allowed the capacity to create dynamic web pages with intractable components. The SPA allowed another layer to be implemented serving as the administrative portal.
  - The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB due to the dynamic and flexible nature of the capacity to make calls to it.

- Functionality
  - JSON could be referred to as an object while JavaScript could be referred to as a set of tools that can use the JSON and more. JSON ties the frontend and backend by signifying the common objects such as the trip and user allowing the backend to understand the structure and the frontend to understand what structure to request
  - In the initial creation of the trips data. We had created a standard trip object in Javascript and that was getting called. We then refactored it into a JSON format so it could be saved and called from the MongoDB. This improved the UI by empowering users to see the data real time and to make and view updates. 

- Testing
  - It was important to test the request and retrieval of API endpoints. This was done through Postman to ensure everything was in working order. Methods are known as functions like GET and POST. Endpoints are where the methods are being called. Oftentimes the suffix of a ‘ / ‘. The security is critical to a full stack application as many layers are exposed and the private information needs to be protected

- Reflection
  - This course has empowered me to understand that I can create a large full stack application and has helped me in starting to reach some professional goals. I have learned a bit about Typescript as well as additional Javascript. These are going to help me become more marketable of a candidate in my career field.
